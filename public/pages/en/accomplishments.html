			<h2>Demoday - Kick Off Porto Digital - Digital Boarding</h2>
			<p>
				During the months of December and January 2021/2022, students from
				SENAC, UNICAP and UNIT received a challenge: to create a
				technology-based solution that contributes to the strengthening of one
				or more of the 169 goals included in the United Nations Sustainable
				Development Goals (Agenda 2030). And I am happy to share that our team
				was among the top 10 squads in the Digital Boarding 2021.2 Kick Off.
			</p>
			<p>
				Presenting the solution to Porto Digital was a great opportunity to
				showcase our work to other entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors, as
				well as receive valuable feedback to improve the solution.

					For the solution, we thought of creating an app that, in a playful and
					educational way, assists students and teachers in basic education. The
					app aims to help teachers teach content in a fun and engaging way,
					improving learning outcomes for students.

			<h2>Demoday - RiseUp at Porto Digital</h2>
			<p>
				During the months of February and June 2022, students from IFPE, SENAC,
				UNICAP, and UNIT were challenged to create a solution proposed by Porto
				Digital's partner companies. Being among the top 12 squads is a great
				achievement, as the program receives several teams from various higher
				education institutions in the Northeast of Brazil.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the RiseUp stage at Porto Digital, my team was challenged to
				create the front-end for Arsenal Inova√ß√£o. We were determined to produce
				quality work and present an appropriate solution for the clients. With a
				lot of hard work, we were able to develop an interface that met the
				client's needs and was intuitive for users.

			<h2>Demoday - GrowUp at Porto Digital</h2>
			<p>
				During the months of August and December 2022, students from IFPE,
				SENAC, UNICAP, and UNIT were challenged to create a solution proposed by
				the partner companies of Porto Digital. In this stage, we were also
				among the 12 best squads.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the GrowUp stage at Porto Digital, my team had another challenge:
				to create the back-end for Arsenal Inova√ß√£o and integrate it with the
				front-end previously developed. It was an opportunity to apply our
				technical skills and collaborate to create a comprehensive and effective
				solution.
