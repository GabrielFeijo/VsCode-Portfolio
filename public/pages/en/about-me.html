				<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Since I can remember, I have always been curious about how things
					work, especially when it comes to website and game development. It was
					through programming game modifications that I discovered my passion
					for programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was amazing to create something from scratch and see everything
					working perfectly. From then on, I knew that this was the career path
					I wanted to pursue. Now, I am always seeking new knowledge and
					challenges to become an even better programmer and to stay up to date
					with the latest developments in the field. I am excited to see where
					this programming journey will take me!

				<h2>üíª Education</h2>
				<p>
					Undergraduate degree in Systems Analysis and Development from
					Faculdade Senac, graduated in 2023. During my studies, I participated
					in the Embarque Digital program, which provided practical learning
					opportunities and mentorship with experienced professionals in the
					field.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my undergraduate studies, I improved my skills in programming,
					database management, web development, mobile development, and system
					development, as well as developed teamwork and problem-solving skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through the Embarque Digital program, I had the opportunity to apply
					the knowledge I gained to real projects, as well as to develop
					specific skills and prepare myself for the job market. I am confident
					that this education has enabled me to make positive contributions in
					future professional opportunities.
