					&lt;!â€” My career in technology has been a journey of continuous
					learning that has allowed me to expand my horizons and evolve
					professionally. Each course was an opportunity to explore new areas,
					learn new skills, and above all, continue to grow as a professional.

					&lt;!â€” It is worth noting that this list of technology certificates is
					only a fraction of the many courses I have taken during my career.
					Over time, I have had the opportunity to delve into many other courses
					and training programs, and I continue to constantly update myself on
					new technologies and trends. â€”&gt;
